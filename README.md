# device_query

A simple library to query mouse and keyboard inputs on demand without a window.
Will work in Windows, Linux on X11, and macOS.

```Rust
use device_query::{DeviceQuery, DeviceState, MouseState, Keycode};

let device_state = DeviceState::new();
let mouse: MouseState = device_state.get_mouse();
println!("Current Mouse Coordinates: {:?}", mouse.coords);
let keys: Vec<Keycode> = device_state.get_keys();
println!("Is A pressed? {}", keys.contains(Keycode::A));
```

# Dependencies

Windows and macOS shouldn't require any special software to be installed for
`device_query` to work properly. On Linux, the X11 development libraries
are required for `device_query` to query state from the OS.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```
sudo apt install libx11-dev
```

On Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:

```
sudo dnf install xorg-x11-server-devel
```
